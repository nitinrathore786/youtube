@D.whimsicalwrld,28:10 timestamp...ravan did not go to ram for his sister or anything. shurpanaka knew the only way to make him act on it was to tell him abot how beautiful sita was. ravan initially wasnt intrested in what happended with his sister and why. it was because of shurpanakas description of sita that he did so. also he did no touch sita not because he was considerate of her.  he had which says that his head would explode if he touches a woman without her consent. that curse was given by ravans own brothers son when ravan raped his brothers sons soon gonna be wife...so tecnically he raped his own soon to be daughter in law.,9,0,0.126,0.822,0.052,-0.8679,Negative

@urnavpal3667,"10:32 a geography major here to explain, the whole structure might have been formed by a volcanic eruption which i suppose is a very good explanation  as to why such a massive structure of rock exists in the middle of nowhere but the black soot( or the black dust) on the surface of the rock is due to dried up moss, this type of petal formation of dead algae or moss can be very commonly observed in sub-tropical region where heavy rainfall and scorching heat is observed. The rain(which as said by you is very heavy in Sri Lanka) leads to algae formation at a heavy rate and then in the dry season Sri Lanka also receives a lot of heat which causes these algae to dry up and form this dust and petal-y structure which is not volcanic ash. The volcanic ash isn't released after the explosion which happened thousands of years ago

but the video overall is really interesting and i learned a lot this video, great content Shlok bhaiya :)",34,7,0.033,0.88,0.087,0.8685,Positive

He built his palace on top of this rock and decorated its sides with colourful frescoes. On a small plateau about halfway up the side of this rock he built a gateway in the form of an enormous lion.

Also the rakh kind of texture you felt is bcz of the fungi and algae that must have grown during rainy reason and is now dried.

@iRajdeepSingh,"I think rocks appear black because over a long period of time, during rainy seasons, a large amount of algae develops on them. After the rainy season, the algae gets burned in the sunlight. This process goes on for many years, causing the rocks to have a black texture. In places where rocks are not black, there should be no effect of rainwater. In some places, somebody cleans the area where they can reach.<br><br>Algae are a diverse group of aquatic organisms that can grow on rocks and other surfaces. They are photosynthetic and can produce pigments that give them a green, brown, or red color. Algae can grow on rocks in both freshwater and saltwater environments. When algae grow on rocks, they can create a dark coating that can make the rocks appear black. This coating is often referred to as “rock varnish” or “desert varnish” and is composed of minerals, clay, and organic matter. The exact process by which rock varnish forms is still not fully understood, but it is thought to involve the growth of bacteria and fungi, as well as the accumulation of wind-blown dust and other particles.<br><br>It is possible that the presence of algae on rocks could contribute to the formation of rock varnish, but this is not the only factor involved. Other factors that can influence the formation of rock varnish include the type of rock, the climate, and the amount of time that the rock has been exposed to the elements. In some cases, the presence of lichens or other organisms on rocks can also contribute to the formation of rock varnish.",0,0,0.02,0.948,0.032,0.6486,Positive
